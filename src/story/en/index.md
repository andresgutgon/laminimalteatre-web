  In October 2010, the workteam of LAminimAL Teatre Sistèmic met for the fist time, under the direction of Daniela De Vecchi, as a theatre researching group in residency at Sala Beckett.

  From then until June 2011, LAminimAL carried out monthly laboratories at Sala Beckett’s Obrador Internacional de Dramaturgia with public presentations, that corroborated with the audience its work in progress through the systemic poetry.

  The play “Waiting for Something” -short play by J. S. Sinisterra- was presented to various festivals in Bar- celona, like Caldera Obert11 and the XII Seminari Acadèmic de Recerca Internacional: Escenaris, Intercanvis i Diversitat, Temporada Off in Girona and in 2012 in Barcelona’s Festival Nunoff.

  The 12/13 season ends up with LAminimAL having premmiered three new shows in Barcelona: in march “How to make a Flower Play… despite everything: The Suicide of the Mortgaged Elephant”, with short texts of José Sanchis Sinisterra, the show launched the new venue Àtic22 from Teatre Tantarantana, becoming an audience and critical’s review success. In may in Sala Beckett, Aina Tur’s “Wednesday”’s premmiere had a very positive response. And to close the season, another audience success with the premmiere of “The Greatness of Being One among Many”, in Sala Atrium during the Atrium LAB Programm.

  For the 13/14 season, LAminimAL is preparing the next part of “How to make a Flower Play… despite everything: The Survival of the Fireflies”. This project, wich will be in FiraTàrrega2014 from September 11th to September 14th, is part of the Support to Creation Programm. Presented, in the IT Emergents Project, in Festival Grec of Barcelona and Temporada Alta of Girona. It has been also in Madrid, in Festival Fringe2014.
